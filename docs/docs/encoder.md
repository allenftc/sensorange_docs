## Analog Usage
The analog output of the encoder scales the voltage from 0.05V to 3.19V to mitigate the effects of variation in the digital-to-analog converter. To measure angle accurately in code, please reference the code below. 
``` java
//Initialization Code
AnalogInput encoder = hardwareMap.get(AnalogInput.class, "encoder");

//Run in Loop
double angle = (encoder.getVoltage()-0.05)/3.142*360;
```

## Quadrature Usage
